							<h2>Blogposts</h2>
							<p>There are many elements and working parts, on both the back end and in the spot light, that work seamlessly to create the beautiful world we live in. This semester I focused on Art and the work that goes into making, producing, and showcasing it. <br><br>
							As a working audio engineer, I explored a day-in-the-life of a touring production, focusing on the general aspects of how a typical day can go.

							<p>I have been working for Midway Production Services, LLC. for four years. When tasked with making a video that stays on subject and theme for the semester, I couldn't think of a better subject to share what I do. I followed two technicians as they load-in VT Soulsice for their Fall Concert at the Lyric Theatre in Blacksburg, Virginia, and six technicians as they load in a VT Athletics Recruiting Banquet at the Frank Beamer indoor practice facility, featuring the VTCC Highty Tighty Marching band.<br><br>
